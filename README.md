### A portfolio website for a small business. Currently building the html and CSS. A little javascript was used. CSS and Html files were getting built and now are done. 
Finished the skeleton. Now working on beautifying. Did first two portions. Finished, just finilizing touches. Working resolution to smaller screen sizes. Testing and finalizing. I have gotten some responsive challenges. Working on mobile version.
